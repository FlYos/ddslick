# ddSlick

A free light weight jQuery plugin that allows you to create a custom drop down with images and description.

## About this plugin

- Adds images and description to otherwise boring drop downs.
- Allows JSON to populate the drop down options.
- Converts your HTML select element to ddSlick.
- Uses Minimum css and no external stylesheets to download.
- Supports callback functions on selection.
- Works as good even without images or description!

## Why is this plugin useful:

With traditional drop downs i.e. using `<select> <option> </option> </select>` you are limited to only text and value. But with this easily configurable jquery plugin, 
you can now create a custom drop down that can very well include images, a short description, along with your usual text and value. Take a look at the following demos in action.
